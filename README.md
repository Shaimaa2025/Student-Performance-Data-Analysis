## 📋 Project Overview
This project applies quantitative research methods to an educational dataset of student performance. As a Ph.D. in Educational Psychology, I conducted this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to bridge the gap between psychological theory and data-driven educational interventions. 

The goal is to identify how demographic, behavioral, and motivational factors—such as study hours and parental education—influence academic achievement.

## 🧹 Data Engineering & Methodology
To ensure scientific accuracy, the analysis followed a structured pipeline:
* **Data Sanitization:** Handled missing values and prepared categorical features for statistical analysis.
* **Distribution Profiling:** Analyzed exam scores to identify patterns and outliers.
* **Bi-variate Exploration:** Investigated the intersection of gender, motivation levels, and parental background with academic outcomes.

## 📊 Key Research Findings
* **Performance Baseline:** Observed a mean exam score of **67.2**, with a tight cluster around the average, suggesting consistent assessment metrics.
* **Study-Success Correlation:** Confirmed a strong positive relationship between **study hours** and **exam scores**, reinforcing the value of time-on-task.
* **Equity Analysis:** Found no statistically significant difference in performance between genders, indicating an equitable assessment environment in this sample.
* **Socio-Behavioral Impact:** Identified that parental education and test preparation levels serve as key indicators of student achievement.
